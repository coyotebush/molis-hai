Password Generation using Markov models, Huffman trees, and Charles Dickens

This repo contains the Racket code that I used to generate markov models and
huffman trees for [Molis Hai](http://www.brinckerhoff.org/molis-hai/pwgen.html),
a random password generator that generates relatively memorable strings.

Give it a try!

If you want to run this code, you'll probably want to start with "letter-frequency.rkt".

Honestly, this should probably all be licensed using Matt Might's CRAPL, rather
than the noble Mozilla Public License 2.0.
